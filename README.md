# README

This is an app which was part of the course "React - The Complete Guide (including Hooks, React Router, Redux)" from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

This app specifically dealt with the the use of React Router and how to make a single page app look like a multi-page app without the page refreshes.  It was a good review/improvement on many of the concepts that I learned at Launch Academy.

The app is deployed to Firebase at https://quotesproject-8120a.web.app/quotes.
